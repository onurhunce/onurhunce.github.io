              I've been interested in analogue photography for more than 6 years now.
              My first camera was a Zenit 122. Since then, I've had many different ones.
              I find trying new cameras exciting, however I also try to keep in mind that
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome">
                it is not about the tool at all.
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The most fun for me is spending time in dark room. Developing my own films
              or printing them on paper gave me a unique satisfaction, although
              I smell like Fixer (The chemical) for 2 days afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Photography was always the best tool for me to express my feelings
              and ideas to others, since I am not best with the words.
              I am lucky enough to have great friends/ photographers around me,
              and we have made some projects together during my college years.
              I always felt more interested in with the light itself, how to put
              it in a form that can charm our eyes. I also try to capture remarkable moments
              with people. Every person I work with is a completely new experience
              and I learn that capturing good moments comes with time, naturally,
              like the light itself.

              I was born and raised in Turkey, but Berlin has been my new home since 2017.
              I earn my money as a Software Developer, so I don't have any expectation
              from photography due to my full time job of.

              One of the reasons that I created this website is to show my work to others,
              maybe arouse, for a second, the feeling of excitement, happiness or sadness.
              However, the main goal is finding new partners to work together with.
              I am looking for photographers to work on some projects together,
              and people who are excited to be in front of camera, to share new experiences together.
